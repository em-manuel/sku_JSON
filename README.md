# sku_JSON
With e-commerce platforms, systems, social media, marketing tools, etc emerging all over, it is becoming difficult to manage a magento/woo commerce/virtuemart site, synch this data with social media, update instagram product posts, synch  shopify and EC wid ... just endless. What's worse, all this is for multiple clients or labels. I propose an open Stock Keeping Unit JSON format, which I dub "SKU_JSON" that  can be used across multiple platforms. The long term goal and hope is that platform can allow creation of endpoints. For example, after setting up your e-commerce shop for a new store, you can make API calls from social media, among other platforms, to synch inventory, probable even real time or triggered on every stock qtty change. 
I welcome anyone who may find this useful to optimise, edit, etc.
